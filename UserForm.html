Here is the example for using a Custom Input Activity.
A webpage needs to be created in order to use the activities.


In this case we have a really simple HTML form 
The page has no limitations in terms of the libraries you can use for the HTML 
-->
<h2>Parametry pro DPH</h2>

<form action="/action_page.php">
  Čtvrtletí:<br>
  <input type="text" name="Čtvrtletí" id="Quarter">
  <br>
  Rok:<br>
  <input type="text" name="Rok" id="Year">
  <br>
  Datum zpracování:<br>
  <input type="text" name="Date" id="Date">
  <br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" id="SubmitButton">
</form> 



<script>
   document.getElementById("SubmitButton").onclick = function() {

		// After the values have been submited we gather all the relevant data
   		var Quarter = document.getElementById("Quarter").value;
   		var Year = document.getElementById("Year").value;
   		var Date = document.getElementById("Date").value;

   		// Contrusct a json string shich contain the values
   		var OutputString = "{\"Quarter\":\"" + Quarter + "\","  +  "\"Year\":\"" + Year + "\"," + "\"Date\":\"" + Date + "\"}";

   		// Here is the important bit. For a to be valid in terms of the activity the following line needs to be included and called at some point in the execution of the form.
   		//Once the command has been called a string can be passed back to UiPath and the form will close
   		window.external.setResult(OutputString);
   		};
</script>
